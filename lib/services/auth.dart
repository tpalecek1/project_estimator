/*
  Description: Implementation of the interface for Authentication.
    The AuthInterface class sets up the prototypes for the methods needed by
    the app for authentication purposes. These methods are designed to have
    universal names and to take-in and return built-in Dart types, this way
    they are independent of the service used for authentication. The Auth class
    implements the AuthInterface methods with the Firebase Authentication
    service. If ever the app wants to use a different authentication service,
    then only the implementation of each method in the Auth class need to be
    re-written with the new service's code, the rest of the app code using the
    authentication code can remain the same.
    Note: the choice of throwing an error message VS rethrowing a Firebase error
          depends on the expected context in which these methods will be called
          i.e. throw 'error message'  -> user should be informed of error (Firebase error translated)
               rethrow Firebase error -> calling code should deal with error (redirect and/or inform user)
